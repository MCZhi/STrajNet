## Dataset
Download the [Waymo Open Motion Dataset](https://waymo.com/open/data/motion/); the files in ```tf_exmaple/``` are used. Place the downloaded files into training and testing folders separately.

Also download the required [scenario IDs files](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/waymo_open_dataset_motion_v_1_1_0/uncompressed/occupancy_flow_challenge/) (.txt) for evalutation and testing
